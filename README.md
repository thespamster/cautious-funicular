# **TEST REPO**

This is my test repo that I am using whilst I study for my diploma.

It is here so that I can familiarise myself with Github, Codeanywhere, 

Linux Terminal, Markdown and anything else coding related, without

fear of ruining/losing anything important!!!

If you've come to see what I can do then please check out my other 

repo's as over time they will be full of projects, code snippets, etc etc.
